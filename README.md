# Chip-8 Interpreter

## Motivation

This is the first step in my journey to learning how to emulate video games. I've always appreciated the emulators that have allowed me to enjoy my childhood video games. GBA, Gamecube, PSP, PS3, mobile games -- these consoles made up a big part of my childhood, aand I want to learn how to emulate them. I want to understand how emulators do it. So far from what I've seen, it seems like quite a complicated task, but I like a good challenge.
