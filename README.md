## Motivation

I'm taking my first steps into the fascinating world of video game emulation! I've always been amazed by emulators and how they let me relive my childhood gaming memories. GBA, Gamecube, PSP, PS3, even mobile games â€“ these consoles were such a huge part of growing up, and now I'm excited to learn how to emulate them myself. It looks pretty complex from what I've seen so far, but I love a tough challenge and I can't wait to dive in!
